    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key - foreign key relationship defines a one-to-many relationship between two tables in a relational database. A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that references the primary key columns in another table. The primary key is defined as a column (or set of columns) where each value is unique and identifies a single row of the table.\n",

    "\n",
    "Right Join: Get all the rows in the second/right table and the common rows of the first table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outer Join: Get all rows in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
